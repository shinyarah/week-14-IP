# week-14-IP
dimentionality reduction, association rules and anomaly detection using R

## Part 1: Dimensionality Reduction

This section of the project entails reducing dataset to a low dimensional dataset using the t-SNE algorithm or PCA. I performed my analysis and provide insights gained from them.

## Part 2: Feature Selection

This section requires you to perform feature selection through the use of the unsupervised learning methods learned earlier this week. You will be required to perform your analysis and provide insights on the features that contribute the most information to the dataset.

## Part 3: Association Rules

This section will require that you create association rules that will allow you to identify relationships between variables in the dataset. You are provided with a separate dataset that comprises groups of items that will be associated with others. Just like in the other sections, you will also be required to provide insights for your analysis.

## Part 4: Anomaly Detection

You have also been requested to check whether there are any anomalies in the given sales dataset. The objective of this task being fraud detection.
